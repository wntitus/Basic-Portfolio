        <p>Hi! I'm a 23 year old currently attending the UCF Coding Bootcamp in Orlando, FL. I've lived in Orlando for about 10
            years now, and while it gets a little too hot and a little too windy sometimes, I can't say that I've hated it.
            I've previously worked at Walt Disney World, Universal Studios, and Starbucks before finally deciding to pursue a career
            in something I've wanted to do for a long time now: coding. I'm super excited to take this journey and I hope you'll
            stick around to see what I'm going to come with not only in the next few months, but in the years to come!
        </p>
